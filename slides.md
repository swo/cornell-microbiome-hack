# Why am I here

- I did my PhD at MIT with Eric Alm
- Dr. Brito ("Ilana") was a close mentor and squash partner
- Dr. Duvallet ("Claire") was a fellow PhD student
- OpenBiome is cool

# My goals for today

I want to point you toward:

- Some particular questions in the microbiome
- Some data types and experimental models
- OpenBiome's work and philosophy

# *C. difficile* is a major public health threat

- It is the most common hospital-acquired infection, affecting 500,000 Americans yearly
- 20% do not respond to antibiotics, and 30,000 die

# OpenBiome started because a family member couldn't get FMT

> In 2011, a close friend [...] contracted a *C. difficile* infection after a
> routine surgery, and antibiotic treatment wasn't working. For 18 months, we
> watched him suffer with this debilitating illness and several rounds of
> failed treatment. [...] he sought but couldn't find a clinician who could
> perform [FMT] for him.  When he finally received a [self-administered]
> life-changing fecal transplant, the effect was remarkable. Within a couple of
> days he had his life back.

# OpenBiome bootstrapped, from humble beginnings

- 2013: Shipped ~100s of treatments using ~1 technician
- 2014: Shipped 1,800 treatments to 170 clinical partners
- 2015: Shipped 7,000 treatments to 520 clinical partners (10% of all recurrent *C. diff* patients)
- 2016: I graduate from MIT and stop thinking about OpenBiome

# A schematic for microbiome science and practice

![](img/schema.svg)

# Application areas ("R-groups") in the microbiome

- "Microbiome" means connecting to human *host health* and *host physiology/immunity*
- Non-human microbiome means different hosts
- (Old school) microbial ecology means connecting to the *environment*
- Agriculture means connecting to *plant health and physiology*

# This schema helps visualize different activities in microbiome science

# Know which way your arrows point to avoid confusion and useless work

- A microbiome *diagnostic* predicts or classifies disease. But is there an easier source of data?
- A microbiome *therapy* treats a disease. How could it be tested?
- A search for a microbiome *mechanism* means you haven't committed to either direction.

# Oil-degrading microbes were unexpected parnters after Deepwater Horizon

- Of spilled Deepwater Horizon oil, humans cleaned up 25% and microbes cleaned up 50%
- Will oil clean up "on its own" when spilled in other places?
- Could we use oil-degrading microbes intentionally?

# A simple experiment was designed to identify oil-degrading bacteria

# OpenBiome is a nonprofit stool bank

Our dual mission is to:

1. Expand safe access to FMT
1. Catalyze research into the microbiome

# OpenBiome's main work is supplying FMT material to treat *C. diff*

- Since founding, we've shipped **46,000** treatment units to 1,200 partners
- Reports from our clinical partners report an efficacy of **80--90%**, comparable to randomized controlled trials
- Our primary goal is to expand safe access to FMT, so we charge the lowest price we can

# FMT for *C. diff* is in a very unusual regulatory situation

- The FDA regulates FMT as a "biologic product", i.e., like a drug, not like a transplant
- (Early practitioners changed the name from "fecal bacteriotherapy" to "transplant" hoping to avoid this situation!)
- To use an unapproved drug, a doctor must fill out an *investigational new drug* (IND) application
- *But* FMT for recurrent *C. diff* does not require an IND

# We expand *safe* access to FMT

- Only **3%** of people who apply to be stool donors pass the logistical, clinical, and laboratory screens.
- We want to avoid known transmissible diseases (e.g., hepatitis) and possible transmissible diseases (e.g., obesity)
- Of 46,000 treatments, we have had **zero** reports of serious adverse definitely related to the FMT material itself

# Universal stool banking has tremendous economies of scale

The alternative is using a new donor for each patient, and having the doctor process the stool.

If 3% of donors pass the test, you need to ask 33 people to get tested before you find a match!

# A stool bank can also catalyze FMT research

OpenBiome provides FMT material to clinical researchers for dozens of clinical trials for dozens of indications:

*C. diff*, inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, hepatic encephalopathy, Sjogren's syndrome, &c. &c.

# We're starting to understand some things about the mechanism of FMT

# For some people, that means we should probably stop doing FMTs

> Dr. Jeffrey I. Gordon of Washington University in St. Louis, [...] urged

> FMT-transmissible leanness] so that, eventually, people can be given pure
> mixtures of bacteria instead of feces. Or, even better, learn what the
> bacteria produce that induces thinness and give that as a treatment.

# But we'd rather take the bet

We'd rather put in the haystack, hoping there's a needle, rather than wait to find the needle.

What if FMT *does* work for something else, and we just didn't try?

# The "GvHD SPIND" is one of our touchstones

- A 5-year old girl got leukemia
- Her leukemia was treated with a bone marrow transplant
- The transplant led her immune system to attack her GI tract (graft-versus-host disease, GvHD)
- After every therapy was exhausted, and this girl was near death, her doctor applied for a single-patient IND
- After FMT, her doctor says it's hard to believe it's the same child; her recovery was so complete

# So we use profits from *C. diff* sales to run OpenBiome-sponsored trials

Work in drug-resistance organism carriage is winding up.

New work in **severe actue malnutrition** and **typhoid carriage** is just beginning.

The only FMT trial in Africa is OpenBiome's malnutrition trial.

# Concluding Zen *ko'an* : Is stool like blood?

![](img/direct_blood.jpg)

- Does it make sense to wait for a defined cocktail? Will it work?
- Blood is the constant counterexample. It's 100 years since we discovered blood groups, and **we still have no blood substitute**.

# Aside: "Sterile fecal filtrate" is my favorite microbiome mystery

> We investigated whether sterile fecal filtrates (containing bacterial debris,
> proteins, antimicrobial compounds, metabolic products, and
> oligonucleotides/DNA), rather than intact microorganisms, are effective in
> patients with CDI.

> In all 5 patients, [fecal filtrate transfer] restored normal stool habits and
> eliminated symptoms of CDI for a minimum period of 6 months.

# Aside: Donor effects are my second-favorite microbiome mystery
